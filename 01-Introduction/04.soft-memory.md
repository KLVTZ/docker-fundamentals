Soft Memory
===========
Soft Memory that most containers have. It is allocated in memory. Order of
magnitude is extremely fast.

Managing Crashes
----------------
- Damaged Ecosystems is easy to manage
- Limit DDoS attacks --you can kill one container and re-launch
- Kill a Single, Relaunch Immediately
- Amplify resources used on AWS
- Don't leave idle instances --enables you to run your instances at full tilt

Security
--------
- Containers Limit attack space
- Kill compromised systems
- Snap-shot replace is readily available

Speed
-----
- Launch speed is unparalled
- One container or thousands to which you may have

Again, you want to use containers because of their resilient soft memory,
control over crashes, security that is isolated and readily replicable, and the
order of magnitude in speed.
