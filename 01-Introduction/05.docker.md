> A story of containers

If you look back and see 1800s freights. There are dock workers taking boxes,
from a ship, into a freight. Others used large nets. Some use large cranes and
nets. Freight movement was very difficult.

A man made a standard container. You can load all your goods and put it on a
train or a vehicle. It was a standard size and thus you could transfer it.
Needless to say, you see will thousands of containers occupying trains, trucks, and
boats. Because of the standardization, it made shipping faster. Cutting shipping
cost in half. Docker is introducing that level of technology in the computer
industry.

Docker provides a standardized container to be hosted on anykind of
service.
