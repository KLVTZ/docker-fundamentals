What is so great about a container?
===================================

A container seems like a cheap version of a hyper-visor. The speed difference is
so huged between a container and a hyper-visor. You can blink and see the
difference in startup time. Hyper-visors can take seconds or minutes to setup.
One huge thing is `Soft Memory`. People love things in memory. It allows faster
pulls of data. Because of the speed of a container, crash management and
resiliency is fast. This is because you can kill a container and startup in
no-time whatsoever.
