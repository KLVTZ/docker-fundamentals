Using Docker
============
- Starting Docker, Interactive Shell, Ports, Committing and More
- Working with Repositories
- Beyond Hello World, Node.js

In this example, we `vagrant ssh` into our docker instance. Once we do so, we
can then start our daemon mode and see which port our service is running on. We
can then download a prebuilt image onto our virtual machine.  What this does is
basically goes through the first steps in downloading an image. We go through a
container of docker to which we can then run applications as services or
stand-alone instances of the operating system.
