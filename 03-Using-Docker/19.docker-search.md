Docker Search
=============
Let's take a look at our earlier command:

```bash
docker run -i -t ubuntu /bin/bash
```
As root, we executed docker to run a container.
- `-i`: option to keep the standard in open
- `-t`: sudo ttyl open
- ubuntu: image that we are using
- /bin/bash the execution

Now that we understand how to run a container. Let's take a look at a few other
useful commands. Some useful commands include:

- `docker ps`: which show a list of active containers.
- `docker search <name_of_instance>`: to search for a specific container

We enabled us the ability to search the docker registry for thousands of
different containers. We pulled a tutorial by `docker pull learn/tutorial`. 

Finally, to demonstrate something unique only to docker, we will run the
container, echo out from the container, and then shutdown the entire container:
`docker run learn/tutorial echo "hello world"`
