Node.js in Docker
=================
We will be getting a basic node.js application running on docker. We will then
access the information on the shared host instance. By doing so, we will
demonstrate how we are containing the node application within docker.

First thing is to clone: [Adron's Bearded Tribble docker example][docker-ex]
into your linux host. This will provide a Dockerfile for us to build our image
or instance

```
# DOCKER-VERSION 0.3.4
FROM    centos:centos6

# Enable EPEL for Node.js
RUN     rpm -Uvh
http://download.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/6/i386/epel-release-6-8.noarch.rpm
# Install Node.js and npm
RUN     yum install -y npm

# Bundle app source
ADD . /src
# Install app dependencies
RUN cd /src; npm install

EXPOSE  8080
CMD ["node", "/src/app.js"]
```

Next, we will build our image: `docker build -t justin/bearded-tribble`. This
will build our image with our with our source as the current directory.  If we
check our image list: `docker images`, will see that we now have a built image.
Next, we need to actually run our image with a port that will be mapped to
access an exposed port on the container. We give it a name so that we may
easily run it from an alias: `docker run -p 49169:8080 -d
justin/bearded-tribble`. If we check the logs, we will see that our node app has
started: `docker logs <container_id>`. Lastly, to actually see the output of the
application, we will cURL the address that is being exposed: `curl -i
localhost:49169`.
